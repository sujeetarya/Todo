# Todo
A simple and free to-do list to get things done, users can prioritize their work with the help of the priority feature and can also sort the list of tasks according to its priority. While I started with the idea of this being a tiny app to get familiar with building apps programmatically, I soon began adding more and more features, as Iâ€™m sure most devs have experienced this.
